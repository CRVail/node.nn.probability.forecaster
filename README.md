# node.nn.probability.forecaster
This repo contains a probability forecaster I developed using brainjs. The solution pulls data, such as space weather and natural events as arguments (NEO positional arguments, celestial events. moon phases, tidal movements, etc) into an array that can be used to forecast probabilities based on pattern recognition.
